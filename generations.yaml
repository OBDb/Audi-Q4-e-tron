It's available in both standard SUV and Sportback body styles with the latter featuring a more coupe-like roofline. The Q4 e-tron is offered with various powertrain configurations, including single-motor rear-wheel drive (Q4 40 e-tron) producing 201 HP and dual-motor quattro all-wheel drive (Q4 50 e-tron) delivering 295 HP. Battery options include 52 kWh and 77 kWh (net capacity) packs, with the larger battery providing up to 320 miles of range (WLTP).
